At each window line, two more people are supported in relation to the previous window

elements of any window = elements of the initial window + 2 * (any window number -1)

elements of any window = n

initial window elements = 1

any window number = a

n = 1 + 2 * (a-1)

a = ((n-1)/2)+1

a = ((n+1)/2)

Sum of Total elements up to any window = (a * (n+1)) / 2

Sum of Total elements up to any window = Sn

Sn = a * ((n+1)/2)

a = ((n+1)/2)

Yn = a * a

Sn = a^2

Sum of Total elements up to any window = any window number TO SQUARE

If (Sn for a given Window >= ticketNumber), then this window (a) = Window where person number X bought the ticket

Rounding the root of any ticket to the next integer, the ticket number in which it is contained is obtained.
