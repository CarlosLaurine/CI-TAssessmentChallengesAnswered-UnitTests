lq = number of block sides

X -> Y = Distance between the Houses of member X to Y

1 round of rehearsals = 1 rehearsal in each square = sum of the distances of each to each possible square except his own * 2 (member goes and returns home)

Sd = Sum of the distances of each to each square except its own = 70 lq

Rd = Distance traveled due to the test round = Sd * 2 = 140 lq

X * Rd = X * 140 lq

1 show = Sum of the distances from each one's house to the point * 2 (member goes and returns)

SdP = Sum of the distances of each one to the Pub

P = Distance traveled due to shows = SdP * 2 lq

P = 42 lq (Fixed)

X * P = X *42 lq

Total distance = (X * 140 lq) + (Y * 42 lq)

Where X is the number of Test Rounds and Y is the number of Shows
