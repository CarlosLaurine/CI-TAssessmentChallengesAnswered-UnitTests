Music is made up of sounds, which are sound waves that vibrate at a frequency.
The main musical notes are C, D, Mi, F, G, A, Si, represented by (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) in this order.

The musical scale with these seven main notes and is subdivided into 12 notes with the distance between two notes
consecutive equal to 1/2 tone or 1 semitone, because between E and F and B and C, there is no sharp/flat (#, b).
In this way, the semitone scale can be represented in the following ways:

Growing
[C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B]

descending
[C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab, A, Bb, B]

The center A (A) has a frequency of 440 Hz (or 440 cycles per second).

To advance half a step (to A#) from A (440) you must do the 440*2^(1/12) operation. to go to B
(that is, advance two halftones), you must, from A (440), do 440*2^(2/12).

Build a function that returns the frequency of any note given that positive values ​​are above A (440)
and negative values ​​are below A (440), and say the name of the note (considering the pitch and semitone scale above,
increasing or decreasing according to your reference to A (440)).

The format of the answer must be an array of two-position strings, with the first being the frequency with 4 decimal places.
whenever the value is not an integer and the second which note this frequency represents, for example: ['440', 'A'] or ["466.1638", "A#"]
