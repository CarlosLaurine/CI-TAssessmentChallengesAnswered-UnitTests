The XPTOs band will record their first album! They went to several friends' studios and realized that by
touch, there was an echo in some of them. Some studios they visited had 8, 16, 18, 24, 36 meters between
amplifiers and the opposite walls

Knowing that people can perceive the echo in a time greater than or equal to 0.1s. Create a function that can determine
if there is echo in a studio according to the distance between the amplifiers and the opposite wall, considering the speed
of sound like 340m/s?
