A survey of people who would participate in a show with multiple stages identified that:

45% like to see the shows on stage A.
33% like to see the shows on stage B.
34% like to see the shows on stage C.
20% like to see shows on stage A and B.
18% like to see shows on stage A and C.
10% like to see shows on stages B and C.
3% like all three places to see shows.

Help the organization of the show to understand what percentage of people do not like any of these stages and
who only like a single stage!
If tickets were sold to 10,000 people, how many would like one-stage concerts?
And if it was for 17,000 people, how many people would like to see concerts from just one stage?
