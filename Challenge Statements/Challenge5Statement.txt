6 friends (Ana, Bia, Cadu, Duda, Edu and Fabi) have a rock band, live near the city center.
The map is the one below, showing where each one lives.

They always take turns rehearsing each day at a member's house and often play in a pub at Place P.

Create a function that calculates the sum of the amount of kilometers traveled in total by the participants,
allowing you to be informed of the number of rounds of rehearsals and shows that the band did.

Assume the distance from the sides of the blocks is 250m and disregard the width of the streets.
