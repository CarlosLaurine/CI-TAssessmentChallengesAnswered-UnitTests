A rock festival consists of a single stage, and the concert area (which is a circle) is divided into 8 sectors of equal areas.
The total area of the show has approximately Larger Area m2, and the central part (Wing VIP) has Smaller Area m2.

You'll need to search the popular wing in sector 3 to find the drumstick that drummer from The XPTOs
he played for the audience, but it was his favorite drumstick and he ended up playing it by mistake, but first, you need to know which one
search area size!

You can help staff by making a function that calculates the search area according to the informed size of the area of the
show and the size of the VIP area?
